<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Will Thorne</span> declares that a
hotel in Petrograd charged him twelve
shillings for four small custards. After
all, the war spirit of Russia, it would
seem, is not wholly dead.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
According to officials of the Food
Ministry, "domestic pastry" may still
be baked. The idea is that this kind
of pastry tends to decrease the total
number of food consumers.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Allied control officers have discovered
fifteen hundred tons of potatoes hidden
in Athens. The Salonika expedition is
now felt to be justified.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
A certain Kingston resident, when out
walking, wears a white band on his hat,
the with words, "Eat less
bread. Do it now." Eyewitnesses
report that the immediate rush of pedestrians
to the tea-rooms to
eat less bread is most gratifying.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"The British loaf," according
to Mr. <span class="sc">Kennedy Jones</span>,
"is going to beat the Germans."
If grit can do it,
we agree.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Allotments under cultivation
in Middlesex," says a
weekly paper breathlessly,
"if place end to end, would
reach five miles." Of course
it is not thought likely that
they will be.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
The father of a lad charged with
embezzlement explained that since the
boy was struck on the head with a
cricket ball he could not keep a penny
novel out of his hands. Speculation is
now rife as to the nature of the accidents
responsible for the passion that
some people entertain for our more
expensive fiction.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"It is possible," says a contemporary,
"that an invention will one day be
forthcoming which will make a clean
sweep of the submarine." Meanwhile
we must expect him to go on acting
like the dirty sweep he is.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
To meet the paper shortage, Austrian
editors have determined to economise by
reducing the daily reports of victories.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
<i>Le Matin</i> states that at a Grand
Council of War sharp disagreement on
the conduct of operations arose between
the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> and <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span>. The
Marshal, we understand, insisted upon
the right to organise his own defeats
without any assistance from the
All-highest-but-one.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
A London dairyman has been heavily
fined for selling water containing a large
percentage of milk.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"To tell the honest truth," said
the Hon. <span class="sc">John Collier</span>, giving evidence
in the Romney case, "we artists do
not think much of the art critics." It
is this dare-devil attitude which
distinguishes your real genius.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Some surprise was recently caused
in Liverpool when the residents learned
from the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> that their
port had been destroyed and all the
inhabitants removed to another town.
They consider that in common fairness
the <i>Cologne Gazette</i> ought to have given
them some idea as to where they were
living.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
It is announced that four German War
Correspondents have been decorated
with the Iron Cross of the Second Class.
We have always maintained that the
War Correspondent, like his fighting
brother, is not immune from the perils
of warfare.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
We are not surprised to learn that
the mouth-organ is the favorite
instrument among the soldiers in a certain
Labour unit. The advantage of this
instrument is that when carried in the
pocket it does not spoil the figure like
a cello.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Now that the shortage of starch
supply will compel men to wear
soft collars it is understood that Mr.
<span class="sc">George Bernard Shaw</span>, who already
wears them soft, proposes to give up
collars altogether, so as not to be mistaken
for an ordinary man.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
City business houses, it is stated,
are adopting the practice of closing
during the dinner-hour. The old
fashioned custom of doing business
and dining on alternate days had much
to recommend it.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
There was no sugar in England when
Crécy and Agincourt were fought, as
Captain <span class="sc">Bathurst</span> told the House of
Commons recently. How the War
Office did without its afternoon tea in
those barbarous days it is impossible
to conjecture.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
The forthcoming Irish Convention is
to be held, it is stated, behind locked
doors. Why not add a charming element
of adventure to the affair by entrusting
some thoroughly absent-minded person
with the key?</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
Lord <span class="sc">Esher</span> believes that
"our home-coming is not
far distant." Meanwhile it
is cheering to know that
quite a number of our
fellows are getting home
on the <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span> line.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Walking canes for ladies
with small round heads of
ivory" are becoming increasingly
popular, declared
a contemporary. We ourselves
would hesitate to
lash the follies of smart
Society in a manner quite
so frank.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
It appears that at the
Bath War Hospital a hen
lays an egg every day in a soldier's
locker. Only physical difficulties prevent
the large hearted bird from laying
it in his egg-cup.</p>

 <hr class="short" />
<p>
<span class="sc">Zambi</span>, a Zulu native, has just died
at the age of a hundred-and-twelve. It
seems that war-worry hastened his end.</p>

<h2>WAYS AND MEANS.</h2>
<p>
I met her at the usual place, and
she looked much the same as usual&mdash;which
astonished me rather.</p>
<p>
"Now that we're engaged," I began.</p>
<p>
"Oh, but we aren't," said Phyllis.</p>
<p>
"Are you by any chance a false
woman?" I asked. "You remember
what you said last night?"</p>
<p>
"I do, and what I said I stick to.
But that was pleasure, and this is
business."</p>
<p>
I looked at her in sudden alarm.</p>
<p>
"You're&mdash;you're quite sure you
aren't a widow, Phyllis?"</p>
<p>
"Quite. Why?"</p>
<p>
"Talking of business at a time like
this. It sounds so&mdash;so experienced."</p>
<p>
"Well, if you <i>will</i> try to settle our
whole future lives in one short week-end
leave, we must at least be practical.
Anyway, it's just this. I'm not going
to be engaged to you until there's
some prospect of our getting married.
I hate long engagements."</p>
<p>
"That means not till after the War,
then," said I disconsolately.</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid it does. But when
once the War's over it won't be long
before you'll be able to keep me in the
style to which I'm accustomed, will
it?"</p>
<p>
"Years and years, I should think,"
said I, looking at her new hat. "It'll
take at least a pound a day even to
start with."</p>
<p>
"Three hundred and sixty-five a
year," said she thoughtfully.</p>
<p>
"And an extra one in Leap Year,"
I warned her.</p>
<p>
"Did I ever tell you," she asked with
pride, "that I have money of my
own?"</p>
<p>
"Hurrah!" I shouted. "You darling!
How splendid!"</p>
<p>
"Jimmy," she said apprehensively,
"you aren't marrying me for it, are
you?"</p>
<p>
"How can I tell till I know how
much you've got?"</p>
<p>
"Well, at a pound a day it would
take us to February 19th. You'd have
to begin from there."</p>
<p>
"What an heiress! Promise you'll
never cast it in my teeth, dear, that
I've got less than you. I've got enough
War Loan to take us on to the 23rd
and halfway through the 24th; and
Exchequer Bonds and things which
will see us through&mdash;er&mdash;to about 7.15
P.M. on March 31st. Then there's my
writing."</p>
<p>
"Oh," she said in a surprised tone
"do they pay you for that? I always
thought you gave them so much a line
to put things in&mdash;like advertisements,
you know."</p>
<p>
"Madam," I answered with dignity,
"when you find yourself, from April 1st
until April 20th, depending each year
upon my pen for the very bread you
eat, perchance you will regret those
wounding words."</p>
<p>
"Well, what else?"</p>
<p>
I shook my head.</p>
<p>
"That's all," I said. "We don't seem
to have got very far, do we? Couldn't
you&mdash;er&mdash;trim hats, or take in washing,
or something?"</p>
<p>
"No&mdash;but <i>you</i> could. I mean, we
haven't counted in your salary yet,
have we?"</p>
<p>
"What salary?"</p>
<p>
"Well, whatever they give you for
doing whatever you do. What were
you getting before the War?"</p>
<p>
"Oh, nothing much."</p>
<p>
"Yes, but <i>how</i> much?"</p>
<p>
"Really," I began stiffly.</p>
<p>
"If you're ashamed to say it right out,
just tell me how far it would take us."</p>
<p>
"To about the end of September, I
should think."</p>
<p>
"Oh, dear! Three more months to
go." A frown wrinkled her forehead;
then her brow cleared. "Why, of
course we haven't counted in the
holidays."</p>
<p>
"They aren't usually an asset."</p>
<p>
"Yes, they are&mdash;if you spend them
with your rich relations. I've got lots,
but I don't think they'd like <i>you</i>
much."</p>
<p>
"All right," said I shortly; "<i>keep</i>
your beastly relations. I shall go to
Uncle Alfred for October. <i>He</i> loves
me."</p>
<p>
"That leaves November and December,"
she mused. "Oh, well, there's
nothing else for it&mdash;we must quarrel."</p>
<p>
"What, now?"</p>
<p>
"No, stupid. Every October 31st,
by letter. Then I'll go home to mother,
and you'll stay with Uncle Alfred some
more. I hope he'll like it."</p>
<p>
"Y-e-s," I said doubtfully. "That
would do it, of course. But we shan't
see very much of each other that way,
shall we? Still, I suppose.... Good
Heavens!"</p>
<p>
"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>
"Phyllis, we've forgotten all about
income-tax. That means about another
two months to account for."</p>
<p>
"My dear, how <i>awful!</i>"</p>
<p>
There was a pause while we both
thought deeply.</p>
<p>
"Couldn't you ... " we began together
at last, and each waited for the
other to finish.</p>
<p>
"Look here," I remarked, "we're
both very good at finding things for
the other to do. Isn't there anything
we could do together&mdash;a job for 'respectable
married couple,' you know?"</p>
<p>
"Why, of course&mdash;caretaking! We'll
look after ducal mansions in the silly
season, when everybody's out of town.
Then we'll see simply heaps of one
another."</p>
<p>
"Yes," I agreed. "And then in the
evenings, when you've scrubbed the
steps and the woodwork and polished
the brass and dusted the rooms and
cleaned the grate and cooked the meals
and tidied the kitchen, and I've
inspected the gas-meter and fed the
canary, or whatever it is a he-care-taker
does, we'll dress ourselves up
and go and sit in the ducal apartments
and pretend we're 'quality.'"</p>
<p>
"And impress our relations by asking
them to dinner there," added Phyllis.
"I think it's a lovely idea. We don't
seem to be going to have much money,
but we <i>shall</i> see life. I'm beginning
to be quite glad I listened to you yesterday,
after all."</p>

<h4>LXI.</h4>

<blockquote><p>
My Dear <span class="sc">Charles</span>,&mdash;Have I ever,
in the course of these <span class="sc">Secret</span> and
<span class="sc">Confidential</span> despatches, called your
lordship's attention to the existence,
the very marked existence, of our
Hubert, "the little Captain," who,
being out of the battle for the moment,
relies upon argument for argument's
sake to keep up his circulation? It
has been said of him that he spends his
office time in writing superior letters
to his subordinates and insubordinate
letters to his superiors; but that, I
think, is over harsh. In any case, as
he  has now run short of grievances,
and the authorities of the B.E.F.
regard him as a joke and like him best
when his little temper is hot, his fights
out here have for some time
lacked reality. I fancy that he
was merely in search of a <i>casus
belli</i> when, being on leave in
the U.K., he conceived the idea
of a day's extension and stepped
round to the War Office to demand
same as of right.</p>
<p>
But the War Office, Charles,
is not as other places and War
Officers are not like the common
sort. Hubert, arriving in
his best fighting trim, was at
once ejected by the policeman
at the door. He underestimated
the importance of that
official and his office, otherwise
he would not have adopted the
just-dropping-in-to-have-a-chat-with-a-friend-inside
attitude. From the constable's
cold response he realised that, in tackling
the W.O. single-handed, he was
attempting a big thing, whereas the
W.O., in tackling him, was not under
the same disadvantage. Then he did
what was unusual with him; he paused
to think before resuming the offensive.
What he wanted, he felt, was big guns.
The House of Commons caught his eye
and reminded him of politicians. He
recalled a slight acquaintance with one
of the more important of these and
went round to call upon him personally.
It was not his idea to obtain any
such authority as would demolish all
opposition at the W.O.; he just hoped
to get a personal chit, which would act
as a smoke barrage and at least cover
his advance right into the middle of the
enemy defences.</p>
<p>
So Hubert asked for the politician
in person, but only got his secretary.
This gentleman, having elicited that
Hubert's train for France left at 5 P.M.,
regretted that the politician would
not be visible till 6. This opposition
warmed Hubert's blood; he asked for
a statement in writing. After some
little discussion he got it, since the
secretary, for all his caution, could see
no harm in an unofficial note, addressed
to no one in particular, and stating
merely that Hubert wanted to see the
politician and the politician was out
till 6 P.M.</p>
<p>
The little captain is one of those who
state their grievances to themselves,
when no other audience is available.
During his return journey to the W.O.
mental processes of no little heat and
significance took place in his busy head,
he putting up an overwhelming case to
show why his leave ought to be, and
must be, extended. The force of this
case gave him such a burning sense
of justice as to carry him, this time,
safely past the policeman.</p>
<p>
Five rows of barbed wire, two of
them electrified, would be but a poor
substitute for the barriers of the W.O.
Before you set foot on the staircase
you have to produce a ticket, and it is
supposed that the porter, who has the
forms to be filled in, forfeits a day's pay
every time he parts with one. Hubert,
gradually losing confidence, wrote upon
the form all he could think of about
himself, and handed it to the porter,
who received it with reluctance, read it
with suspicion, and disappeared with a
grunt. What he did with it is not
known; probably someone got into
communication with the B.E.F. to
know if such a person as Hubert
existed, and, if so, why? Meanwhile
Hubert had good time to realise that
no one loved him and that this was
cold brutal war at last.</p>
<p>
Bit by bit the porter drifted back and
gave Hubert his form, now stamped
and become his ticket. The porter
having finished with him, he passed on
and, after many wanderings, found the
door of the room where his sentence
would be passed. Bracing himself up
and clearing his throat, he prepared to
knock and enter. Fortunately, however,
his audacious intention was observed
by an official and frustrated. He was
commanded to write something more
about himself in the book provided for
that purpose, and to go on waiting.
Being now an expert at writing and
waiting he did as he was bid, spending
the next few hours of his life remodelling
his case in less fierce and glowing
terms.</p>
<p>
At last the door of the room persuaded
itself to open and let out a real
red god, who looked upon Hubert, took
an instant dislike to him, relieved him
of his ticket and went in again. During
the ensuing period of suspense the last
vestige of Hubert's personality departed
from him.</p>
<p>
Again the door opened and another
red one, even more godlike,
emerged clamouring for Hubert
and his blood. Had he
still been in possession of his
ticket (a necessary passport for
egress) Hubert would have fled.
There was nothing for it but
to confess his identity and to
hope for mercy. The god, who
clearly had not more than three
and a half seconds to spare,
demanded an explanation of
his presence. Hubert admitted
that once, in a moment of impudent
folly, he had thought
of asking for a day's extension.
The god said nothing,
but a light smouldered in
his eyes which intimated to
Hubert that if he did not at
once produce some paramount
excuse for so monstrous a request the
War would be held up and the military
machine would be concentrated on
punishing Hubert. His tongue clove
to the roof of his mouth; even if it had
been available it would have helped
little, for it is more than mere words
that the gods require. His hand
searched in his pockets and produced
the return half of his leave warrant,
a five-franc note, a box of matches,
a recently purchased paper flag and
the politician's secretary's note. The
first and the last were taken, the rest
fell to the floor, the door closed once
more and again Hubert was alone.</p>
<p>
Hubert doesn't know what he did
next; probably, he thinks, he sat down
and wept, and it was his tears that
induced the gods not to convert his
ticket into a death-warrant, but instead
to give him the slip, "Leave extended
one day for urgent private business."
This was clearly one of Hubert's most
decisive victories. He had his day's
extension solely in order to interview
the politician at 6 P.M.; he was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span>
interview the politician solely in order
to obtain his day's extension. But
Hubert insists morbidly that his was a
moral defeat, amounting to utter suppression.
He called upon the politician
at 6 P.M. to thank him personally.
Again he could get no further than the
secretary, who, learning that Hubert's
train would not depart at all that day,
regretted that the politician would, on
second thoughts, be out for a week.
"Now if I really <i>had</i> triumphed,"
said Hubert, "I should have got the
secretary to put that also in writing,
and should have stepped round to the
War Office again to demand a further
week's extension on the strength of
it." This, however, he did not do.</p>

<h2>PETHERTON'S PUBLICATIONS.</h2>
<p>
A glance at a well-known publisher's
window, during a recent visit
to London, provided me with material
for a little possible quiet amusement,
and with this end in view I penned the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Mr. Petherton</span>,&mdash;When up in
town the other day I was surprised and
delighted to notice in Messrs. Egbert
Arnwell's window two works of yours,
one on Bi-Metallism and the other on
the Differential and Integral Calculus.
Nothing but the prices (really low ones
for such works) prevented my purchasing
a copy of each book at once.</p>
<p>
I cannot resist writing to congratulate
you on the publication of these
volumes, which will, I am sure, add to
the instruction if not to the gaiety of
nations. Of course I knew&mdash;and have
had the most complete olfactory proofs&mdash;that
you were a chemist of at least
strong views, but had no idea that
your range of knowledge was so extensive
as it apparently is.</p>

<p class="author">
With renewed congratulations,<br />
Believe me, yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="sc">Henry J. Fordyce.</span>
</p>
<p>
By the way, what is a calculus?
Could one be obtained in Surbury, or
would it be necessary to order from the
Army and Navy Stores?</p>
<p>
This brought forth:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;I greatly regret that my latest
publications should have caught your
eye, and look on your congratulations
as a studied insult.</p>
<p>
I should hardly expect a person of
your (as I imagine) limited intellect to
know anything about the scientific subjects
which interest me, but I feel sure
that you are perfectly aware that the
calculus is abstract and not concrete.</p>
<p>
Had you tried to convey sincere congratulations
to me I could have borne
the infliction with resignation, but I
strongly object to such flippant impertinences
as are contained in your
communication.</p>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="sc">Frederick Petherton.</span>
</p>
<p>
I felt this was a good start, and so
put out more bait:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Petherton</span> (I wrote),&mdash;Sorry
you couldn't accept my letter in the
spirit, etc.</p>
<p>
I've had such a priceless idea since
I wrote to you last, and it is this. I
propose that we start a Literary Society
in Surbury. I'm certain the Vicar would
join in. Mr. Charteris, of the Manor,
too would, I feel confident, welcome
the idea. Dr. Stevenson, the only one
to whom I have broached the subject,
got keen at once, and the Gore-Langleys
and others could no doubt be counted
on&mdash;say a dozen altogether, including
you and myself. I append a short list
of suggested contributions, which will
give some idea of the range of subjects
which might be tossed into the arena
of debate:&mdash;</p>
<ul><li>
<span class="outdent">The Binomial Theorem in its</span>
relation to the Body Politic
(yourself).</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">Cows and their sufferings during</span>
the milk controversy in the newspapers
(Charteris. This might
be published in small quarto).</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">The  attitude  of   the  Manichean</span>
Heresiarch towards the use of
Logarithms (The Vicar).</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">The effect of excessive Philately on</span>
the  cerebral  organisms of  the
young (Gore-Langley).</li>
<li>
<span class="outdent">The  introduction of  the art and</span>
practice  of Napery among the
Dyaks  of   Borneo   (Miss   Eva
Gore-Langley).</li>
</ul>
<p>
With a few additions I think we
should have enough mental food to
keep us going through the summer;
and I may add that if you were put up
for President of the Society I should
certainly second the motion.</p>

<p class="author">
Yours ever,<br />
<span class="sc">Harry Fordyce</span>.
</p>
<p>
I notice that your writing has gone
to pieces rather, old man&mdash;through
writer's cramp, I fear. You say what
looks like "you are perfectly aware
that the calcalus is asphalt and not
concrete." Of course I do know that
much about it.</p>
<p>
My letter kept the ball rolling all
right, for Petherton replied:&mdash;-</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Have you no sane moments?
If you have any such, I should be glad
if you would employ the next lucid
interval in setting your affairs straight
and then repairing to the nearest asylum
with a request that they would protect
you against yourself by placing you in
a padded cell. This done and the key
lost, the world, and Surbury in particular,
would be a happier place.</p>
<p>
You cannot seriously suggest that
any society for literary discussion could
be formed here or elsewhere which
should include yourself, and even so
you must know that your being a member
would prevent my joining it.</p>
<p>
Has the call for National Service not
reached your ears yet? You appear to
have plenty of leisure time on your
hands which might be better employed.
Or have you offered yourself and been
rejected on the grounds of mental
deficiency?</p>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="sc">Frederick Petherton</span>.
</p>
<p>
I didn't feel called upon to make a
song about my method of doing my bit,
which, I am glad to say, has the approval
of the authorities; but I was
anxious to hear Petherton's joints crack
once more, so I wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Dear Freddy</span>,&mdash;Your letters get
better and better in style as your writing
deteriorates. I am very sorry to gather
from your last that you look coldly on
my scheme. I am sure that those to
whom I have mentioned the idea would
decline to entertain it if it lacked your
active support, so I trust you will reconsider
the matter.</p>
<p>
I am thinking over your asylum stunt.
It would certainly save some expense,
and if this terrible War continues much
longer it will, I fear, drive me to such a
refuge; though I trust in that event that
I shall be allowed to choose pleasanter
wall hangings than those you suggest.
I'm rather fond of light chintzy papers,
aren't you? They're so cheerful.</p>
<p>
Hoping to hear from you <i>re</i> our little
society at your earliest ("The Surbury
Literary and Scientific Society" would
sound well, and would look rather nice
on our note-paper&mdash;what?)&mdash;</p>

<p class="author">
I am, yours as ever, <br />
<span class="sc">Harry</span>.</p>

<p>
Petherton saw red again and bellowed
at me, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;  you and your beastly
society.  I don't know who is the more
execrable, you or the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span>.</p>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="sc">Frederic Petherton</span>.
</p>
<p>
Common decency compelled me to
reply, so I wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">My Dear Old Boy</span>.&mdash;You don't know
how grieved I am to hear that you
cannot entertain the scheme.</p>
<p>
Of course I can read between the
lines, and know that your heart is in it,
and that it is only the many calls on
your time which prevent your active
co-operation with me in the matter.
Of course, needless to say, your lack of
support has killed what looked like
being a promising scientific bantling
(through stress of emotion I nearly
wrote "bantam," which brings me to
the subject of poultry. How are yours?
I forgot to ask before).</p>
<p>
I hope the question of the S.L. &amp; S.S.
will now be dropped; it is too painful.
If you insist on continuing the discussion
I shall decline to answer the letter,
so there!</p>

<h3>THE SECRETS OF HEROISM.</h3>
<p>
"Don't talk about heroism," said
Sergeant William Bingley, "until you
know what it is&mdash;and isn't.</p>
<p>
"There were two men in my platoon
over there that I'd match against any
other two in the British, Allied, or
Enemy armies for the biggest funks on
earth; two boys from the same town,
as unlike as cross-bred puppies, but
cowards to the ankles.</p>
<p>
"They were the only two that didn't
volunteer for a listening picket one
night, and I felt so ashamed of them
that I decided to mention it.</p>
<p>
"'You nickel-plated, glass-lined
table-ornament,' I said to Ruggles
when I found him alone, 'aren't you
ashamed to form a rear rank alone with
Jenks every time you're asked to do
anything?'</p>
<p>
"I knew they hated each other, and
I thought I'd draw him, but he hadn't
a word for himself.</p>
<p>
"'Tell me what you joined for,' I
said more persuasively, for he had been
in the Army over a year. 'You're the
only man in the company, bar your
friend Jenks, that turns white at the
pop of a cork out of a Worcester sauce
bottle.'</p>
<p>
"He stroked the bit of hair behind
his right ear and let slip a grin like
the London and Country mail slots at
the G.P.O.</p>
<p>
"'I'll tell you, Sergeant,' he said.
'I never had much heart for soldiering,
and I only joined up when I did to
spite the girl that jilted me. She jilted
me for Jenks, and no sooner did she say
the word to him than she talked him
into enlisting too.... That's why
I'm no good. Every time I remember
I'm a soldier I think of her laughing
at me, and I feel a fool.'</p>
<p>
"'Well,' said I, 'she must be proud
of you both, for you're the weariest,
wonkiest pair of wash-outs I ever swore
at.'</p>
<p>
"I didn't send for Jenks; I could
guess his excuse. He had obviously
about as much spirit for fighting as
Ruggles, and he was just hanging on
and trying not to get hurt before the
War stopped.</p>
<p>
"We had a few weeks out of the
trenches after my chat with Ruggles,
and one afternoon I came upon them
enjoying a hearty, homely, ten-round
hit, kick, and scramble in a quiet corner
near their billet. They looked as if
they meant it, but they finished up in
about ten minutes, hugging each other
in six inches of mud. Ruggles got up
first, and while he waited for Jenks he
turned on his Little Tich smile. It
worked; Jenks smiled too, and the
rivals went off together like brothers.</p>
<p>
"I said nothing, and forgot them
again&mdash;clean forgot them, until, a week
later, Jenks came to me in Number Seven
with a yarn about a crater and a sniper,
and might he go and perforate him.</p>
<p>
"I had noticed the sniper myself, so
I sent Jenks to chase a broom and
picked my own men for this job that
mattered. I'd no sooner done it than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span>
Ruggles marched up and asked to be
made one of the party.</p>
<p>
"I just stared at him, and his grin
stretched half an inch each way.</p>
<p>
"'I saw Jenks asking you,' he told
me, 'and I won't be behind Jenks.
Besides, it was me told him of the
sniper.'</p>
<p>
"'It's a change for you two to be
worrying over snipers,' I said.</p>
<p>
"'Well, you're not grumbling at
that, are you, Sergeant?' said he.</p>
<p>
"'I am not,' I said. 'And I hope
you'll keep it up until we're relieved.'</p>
<p>
"'You watch us,' he answered.</p>
<p>
"I did. It was Ruggles that put his
bayonet into the machine-gunner that
had knocked out half the company.
He took the last two bullets in his
arm and side; and it was Jenks that
put himself between Ruggles' head and
the revolver that would have made
pulp of it if Jenks hadn't got the hand
that held it. He took the bullet in
his cheek.</p>
<p>
"I saw them in the dressing-station
when the shouting was over. Ruggles
was laughing at what Jenks's face
would look like when it was out of
bandages. The bullet had taken away
about a third of an ear. Jenks was
cursing because it hurt to laugh back.</p>
<p>
"'Never mind,' I said to him with
a wink at Ruggles, 'I warrant there's
some little girl who won't laugh at
you when you get back home. She
has more to be proud of now than
your face.'</p>
<p>
"'Then you're wrong, Sergeant,' he
answered quietly. 'She's changed her
mind. She's <i>his</i> girl now.'</p>
<p>
"I looked at Ruggles. He wouldn't
catch my eye, but a blush was working
round towards his neck.</p>
<p>
"'And I've changed my mind too,'
said Jenks. 'D'you think I'd have
taken those risks I took to-day if there
was a girl at home worrying over every
casualty list? A man's a fool to risk
breaking a heart to try to get a medal.'</p>
<p>
"'Ay, that's the way you look at
it,' said Ruggles, as red as beetroot.
'But I bet the Sergeant's glad she's
changed her mind. I never knew your
equal for a clammy coward, Jim, before
she chucked you up.'</p>
<p>
"Jenks began to look black. 'There
were two of us, anyway,' he said.</p>
<p>
"'P'r'aps there were,' Ruggles agreed
cheerily. 'But what's the good of
making a show of your soldiering unless
there's someone at home looking
on and caring?'"</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>
<i>Monday, May 21st</i>.&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Maccallum
Scott</span> complained that a question of
his relating to the prohibition of
"dropped scones"&mdash;which Captain
<span class="sc">Bathurst</span>, that encyclopædia of food-lore,
described as falling "under the
same category as the crumpet"&mdash;had
been addressed to the Ministry of Munitions
instead of the Ministry of Food.
It was really a venial error on the
part of the Clerk at the Table, for the
modern scone distinctly suggests a missile
of offence, and is much more like a
"crump" than a crumpet. If <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span>
were acquainted with our London
tea-shops (<i>consule</i> <span class="sc">Devonport</span>) he would
never have imagined that his famous
phrase about "biting upon granite"
would have any terrors for the British
recruit.</p>
<p>
When the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> read from
his manuscripts the proposed conditions
of the Irish Convention&mdash;how it must
include representatives not only of political
parties, but of Churches, trade
unions, commercial and educational
interests, and of <i>Sinn Fein</i> itself; and
must be prepared to consider every
variety of proposal that might be
brought before it&mdash;an Irish colleague
whispered to me, "Sure, the Millennium
will be over before we get it."</p>
<p>
Nothing could have been handsomer
than Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond's</span> welcome to the
proposal. All he was concerned for, I
gathered, was that his Unionist opponents
should be generously represented.
Ulster, in the person of Sir <span class="sc">John Lonsdale</span>,
made no corresponding advance.
He would submit the proposal to his
constituents, but not apparently with
letters commendatory.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 280px;">
<a href="images/354-2.png"><img src="images/354-2-274.png" width="274" height="450" alt="Pessimist's design for costume of Chairman of Irish Convention." /></a>
<p><span class="sc">Pessimist's design for costume of
Chairman of Irish Convention</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>
I daresay Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> set
out with the honest intention of blessing
the Government plan, of which
indeed he claims to be the "onlie
begetter." But the sound of his own
voice&mdash;in its higher tones painfully
provocative&mdash;stimulated him to proceed
to a dramatic indictment of his
former colleagues. I felt sorry for the
prospective Chairman, charged with
the task of attempting to reconcile
these opposites.</p>
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Healy</span>, cowering beneath the
shelter of his ample hat, as Mr.
<span class="sc">O'Brien's</span> arms waved windmill-like
above him, must have felt like <i>Sancho
Panza</i> when the <i>Don</i> was in an extra
fitful mood; but he kept silence even
from good words.</p>
<p>
The briefest and most helpful speech
of the afternoon came from Sir <span class="sc">Edward
Carson</span>, who, while declaring that he
would never desert Ulster, nevertheless
made it plain that Ulster on this occasion
should take her place beside the
rest of Ireland. Only Mr. <span class="sc">Ginnell</span>
remained obdurate. In his ears the
Convention sounds "the funeral dirge
of the Home Rule Act."</p>
<p>
<i>Tuesday, May 22</i>.&mdash;If you should
happen to see of a Sabbath morning
a stream of official motor-cars leaving
London with freights of the brave and
the fair you may be sure they are going
on some National business. Both the
War Office and the Admiralty keep
log-books, in which are faithfully entered&mdash;I
quote Dr. <span class="sc">Macnamara</span>&mdash;"full
particulars of each journey, the number
and description of passengers carried
and the amount of petrol consumed."
Do not therefore jump to the hasty
and erroneous conclusion that the gallant
fellows and their charming companions
are "joy-riding;" such a thing
is unknown in Government circles.</p>
<p>
The <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> moved the
second reading of the Representation
of the People Bill with a suavity befitting
a <span class="sc">Cave</span> of Harmony; and by
the clearness of his exposition very
nearly enabled the House to understand
the mysteries of proportional representation,
though even now I should not
like to have to describe off-hand the
exact working of "the single transferable
vote."</p>
<p>
The opponents of the Bill were well-advised
in selecting Colonel <span class="sc">Sanders</span> as
their champion. With his jolly round
face, bronzed by the suns of Palestine,
he looks the typical agriculturalist. He
may, as he says, have forgotten in the
trenches all the old tricks of the orator's
trade, but he has learned some useful
new ones, and while delighting the
House with his sporting metaphors
struck some shrewd blows at a measure
which he regards as unfair and
inopportune.</p>
<p>
For almost the first time since the
War Lord <span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span> was discovered
in quite his best form. The House
rippled with delight at his refusal to be
forcibly fed with a peptonized concoction,
prepared by the <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Conference
in the belief that the Mother of
Parliaments was too old and toothless
to chew her own victuals. "This Bill
is Benger's Food, and you, Sir, and
your Committee are Bengers."</p>
<p>
The <span class="sc">Solicitor-General's</span> solid and
solemn arguments in favour of the Bill
fell a little flat after this sparkling attack.
He should have said, "The noble Lord
reminds me, not for the first time, of
<span class="sc">Gilbert's</span> 'Precocious Infant,' who</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
  <p>'Turned up his nose at his excellent pap&mdash;</p>
    <p class="i2">"My friends, it's a tap</p>
    <p class="i2">Dat is not worf a rap."</p>
  <p>(Now this was remarkably excellent pap).'"</p>
</div>

<p>
<i>Wednesday, May 23rd</i>&mdash;The Russian
officers who adorned the Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery this afternoon must
be a little puzzled by the vagaries of
British politics. They had been informed,
no doubt, that the most urgent
problem of the day was caused by
the desire of one of the British Isles
to manage its own affairs. Yet the
first thing they heard at Westminster
was the petition of another of these
Isles&mdash;that of Man&mdash;begging release
from the burden of Home Rule and
demanding representation in the Imperial
Parliament. Perhaps this little
incident will help our visitors to appreciate
why Englishmen do not invariably
form a just judgment of events in other
countries&mdash;Russia, for instance.</p>

<p>
<i>The Telephone</i>. <span class="sc">Rr-rr-rr-rr</span>.</p>
<p>
<i>The Marshal</i>. Curse the infernal telephone! A man
doesn't get a moment's peace. Tush, what am I talking
about? Who wants peace? If we were all to be quite
candid there might be&mdash;</p>
<p>
<i>The Telephone</i>. Rr-rr.</p>
<p>
<i>The Marshal</i>. All right, all right, I'm coming. Yes, I'm
Marshal <span class="sc">Von Hindenburg</span>. Who are you? What? I can't
hear a single word. You really must speak up. Louder&mdash;louder
still, you fool. What? Oh, I really beg your
Majesty's pardon. I assure you it was impossible to hear
distinctly, but it's all right now. I thank your Majesty, I
am in my usual good health. Yes. No, not at all. Yes,
I have good hope that we shall now maintain ourselves for
at least two days. Yes, if we are forced to retire we must
say it is according to plan. No, I don't like it either, but
what is to be done? Their guns are more numerous and
heavier than ours, and weight of metal must tell. Will
I hold the line? Yes, certainly, till your Majesty returns
and graciously resumes the conversation. Oh, you didn't
mean that line? You meant the Siegfried line, or the
Wotan line, or the Hindenburg line? Yes, I see, it was
a <i>Witz</i>, a play of words. Yes, I am sorry I could not at
once see what your Majesty was driving at, but now I see
it is good. I must practise my joking. Ha-ha-ha! Are
you there? No, he's gone (<i>rings off</i>). (<i>To himself</i>) He
is a queer Emperor who is able to make jokes while his
soldiers are dying by thousands and thousands. It can't
last like this&mdash;and as for the Hindenburg line, I'm
perfectly tired to death of the words; and the thing itself
doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
<i>The Telephone</i>. Rr-rr-rr-rr.</p>
<p>
<i>The Marshal</i>. What, again? This is too much&mdash;who
are you?  Who?  <span class="sc">Who</span>? General <span class="sc">Von Kluck</span>?  Impossible.
General <span class="sc">Von Kluck</span>'s dead. What&mdash;not dead?
Anyhow, nobody's heard of him for months. If you're
really General <span class="sc">Von Kluck</span> I'm afraid we must consider
you to be dead. The <span class="sc">Emperor</span> won't regard it as very good
taste on your part to come to life again like this. He's
very unforgiving, you know. You don't care? But, my
dear dead General <span class="sc">Von Kluck</span>, you must care. What is it
you say you wanted to do? Congratulate me? What on?
My splendid defence of the Hindenburg line? Now, look
here. As one German General to another do you mean to
tell me you believe in the Hindenburg line? No, of course
you don't. You thought I believed in it? Was that what
you said? Come, don't wriggle, though you are a dead
man. Yes, that was what you said. Well, then understand
henceforth that there is no Hindenburg line and
there never was anything of the sort. Why am I retreating
then? Because I must. That's the whole secret. Why
did <i>you</i> retreat after your famous oblique march during the
Battle of the Marne? Because you had to, of course.
There&mdash;that's enough. I can't waste any more time. What?
Oh, yes, you can congratulate me on anything you like
except that. And now you had better return to the grave
of your reputation and remain there (<i>rings off</i>).</p>
<p>
<i>The Telephone</i>. Rr-rr-rr-rr.</p>
<p>
<i>The Marshal</i>. To h-ll with the telephone! Who is it
now? What&mdash;an editor of a newspaper? That's a little
bit too thick. What is it you want? To thank God for
that masterpiece of bold cunning, the Hindenburg line?
Is that what you want? Well, make haste, for the masterpiece
doesn't exist. No, I'm not joking. I can't joke.
Enough (<i>rings off</i>).</p>

<h2>EMILY'S MISSION.</h2>
<p>
It was all through Emily that I am
to-day the man I am.</p>
<p>
We were extraordinarily lucky to get
her; there was no doubt about that.
Her testimonials or character or references
or whatever it is that they come
to you with were just the last word.
Even the head of the registry-office,
a frigid thin-lipped lady of some fifty
winters, with an unemotional cold-mutton
eye, was betrayed, in speaking
of Emily, into a momentary lapse from
the studied English of her normal vocabulary.</p>
<p>
"Madam," she said to my wife, "I
have known many housemaids, but
never one like this. She is, I assure
you, Madam, absolutely <span class="sc">it</span>."</p>
<p>
So we engaged her; and ere long
I came to hate her with a hatred
such as I trust I shall never again
cherish for any human being.</p>
<p>
In almost every respect she
proved perfection. She was honest,
she was quick, she was clean; she
loved darning my socks and ironing
my handkerchiefs; she never
sulked, she never smashed, her hair
never wisped (a thing I loathe in
housemaids). In one point only
she failed, failed more completely
than any servant I have ever
known. She would not make my
shaving-water really hot.</p>
<p>
Cursed by nature with an iron-filings
beard and a delicate tender
skin, I was a man for whom it was
impossible to shave with comfort
in anything but absolutely boiling
water. Yet morning after morning
I sprang from my bed to find the
contents of my jug just a little over
or under the tepid mark. There was
no question of re-heating the water
on the gas stove, for I never allowed
myself more than the very minimum
of time for dressing, swallowing my
breakfast and catching my train. It
was torture.</p>
<p>
I spoke to Emily about it, mildly at
first, more forcibly as the weeks wore
on, passionately at last. She apologised,
she sighed, she wrung her hands. Once
she wept&mdash;shed hot scalding tears, tears
I could gladly have shaved in had they
fallen half-an-hour earlier. But it made
no difference; next morning my water
was as chill as ever. I could not understand
it. Every day my wrath grew
blacker, my reproaches more vehement.</p>
<p>
Finally an hour came when I said to
my wife, "One of two things must
happen. Either that girl goes or I grow
a beard."</p>
<p>
Mildred shook her head. "We can't
possibly part with her. We should
never get another servant like her."</p>
<p>
"Very well," I said.</p>
<p>
On the morrow I started for my
annual holiday, alone. It was late
summer. I journeyed into the wilds
of Wiltshire. I took two rooms in an
isolated cottage, and on the first night
of my stay, before getting into bed, I
threw my looking-glass out of the
window. Next morning I began. Day
by day I tramped the surrounding
country, avoiding all intercourse with
humanity, and day by day my beard
grew.</p>
<p>
I could feel it growing, and the first
scrubbiness of it filled me with rage.
But as time slipped by it became softer
and more pliable, and ceased to irritate
me. Freed, too, from the agony of
shaving, I soon found myself eating my
breakfast in a more equable frame of
mind than I had enjoyed for years. I
began also to notice in my walks all
sorts of things that had not struck me
at first&mdash;the lark a-twitter in the blue,
the good smell of wet earth after rain,
the pale gold of ripening wheat. And
at last, before ever I saw it, very
gradually I came to love my beard, to
love the warm comfort and cosiness of
it, and to wonder half timidly what it
looked like.</p>
<p>
When I left, just before my departure
for the six-miles-distant station, I called
for a looking-glass. They brought me
a piece of the one I had cast away. It
was very small, but it served my purpose.
I gazed and heaved a sigh of
rapturous content; a sigh that came
from my very heart. My beard was
short and thick, its colour a deep
glorious brown, with golden lights here
and there where the sunbeams danced
in some lighter cluster of its curling
strands. A beard that a king might
wear.</p>
<p>
I have never shaved again. Every
morning now, while untold millions of
my suffering fellows are groaning beneath
their razors, I steal an extra
fifteen minutes from the day and lie
and laugh inside my beard.</p>
<p>
"And what of Emily?" you ask.</p>
<p>
Almost immediately after my return
she left us. She gave no reason. She
was not unhappy, she said. She wished
to make a change, that was all. To
this day my wife cannot account for
her departure. But I know why
she went. Emily was a patriot
with a purpose. A month after she
parted from us I received a letter
from her:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I ask you to
take into consideration the fact
that by having ceased to shave you
will in future be effecting a slight
economy in your daily expenditure?
Might I also suggest to you that
during the remainder of the War
you should make a voluntary contribution
to the national exchequer
of every shilling saved under this
head? The total sum will not
be large, but everything counts.
Yours is, if I may be allowed to
say so, the finest beard I have
been instrumental in producing
during my two and a half years'
experience in domestic service. I
am now hard at work on my sixth
case, which is approaching its
crisis.</p>
<p>
Apologising for any temporary
inconvenience I may have caused
you, I am,<br /><br /></p>

<p>
I never showed the letter to my wife,
but I have acted on Emily's suggestion.
I often think of her still, her whole soul
afire with her patriotic mission, flitting,
the very flower of housemaids, from
home to home, lingering but a little
while in each, in each content for that
little while to be loathed and stormed
at by an exasperated shaver, whom
she transforms into a happy bearded
contributor to her fund.</p>

<h3>THE FIFTEEN TRIDGES.</h3>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a flourishing
covey of fifteen: Pa Tridge, Ma
Tridge, and thirteen little Tridges, all
brown and speckled and very chirpy.
They had been born in a hollow under
some big leaves beside a hedge, and
they now moved about the earth, pushing
their way through the grass, all
keeping close together when they could,
and setting up no end of a piping when
they couldn't and thought they were
lost.</p>
<p>
It was a large family from our point
of view, and larger perhaps than a prudent
French partridge would approve,
but the world is wide, and there are no
butcher's or baker's or tailor's or dress-maker's
bills to pay for little birds. All
that a Pa and Ma Tridge have to do
after fledging is complete is to look
out for cats and hawks and foxes, to
beware of the feet of clumsy cattle, and
to administer correction and advice.
Above all there are no school bills,
made so doubly ridiculous among ourselves
by German measles and other
epidemics during which no learning is
imparted, but for which, educationalists
being a wily crew, no rebate is
offered.</p>
<p>
There being so little to be done for
their young, it is no wonder, in a
didactic and over-articulate world, that
parent Tridges take almost too kindly
to sententiousness; and young Tridges,
being so numerous as to constitute a
public meeting in themselves, are specially
liable to admonishment.</p>
<p>
It was therefore that, strolling aimlessly
amid the herbage or the young
wheat with their audience all about
them, Pa and Ma Tridge got into a
habit of counsel which threatened to
become so chronic that there was a
danger of its dulling their sensibility to
the approach of September the first.</p>
<p>
"Never," Pa Tridge would say, "criticise
anyone or anything on hearsay.
See for yourself and then make up
your own mind; but don't hurry to
put it into words."</p>
<p>
"Tell the truth as often as possible,"
Pa Tridge would say. "It is not only
better citizenship to do so, but it makes
things easier for yourself in the long
run."</p>
<p>
"Always bear in mind," Ma Tridge
would say, "that after one has married
one's cook she ceases to cook."</p>
<p>
"Never tell anyone," Pa Tridge would
say, "who it was you saw in the spinney
with Mr. Jay or Mrs. Woodpecker."</p>
<p>
"Indeed," he would add, "you might
make a note that the world would not
come to a miserable end if everyone
was born dumb"&mdash;but he was very
glad not to be dumb himself.</p>
<p>
"Even though you should get on
intimate terms with a pheasant," Ma
Tridge would say, "don't brag about it."</p>
<p>
"Forgive, but don't forget," Pa Tridge
would say.</p>
<p>
"Remember," Pa Tridge would say,
"that, though it may be wiser to say
No, most of the fun and all the adventure
of the world have come from saying
Yes."</p>
<p>
"Bear in mind," Ma Tridge would
say&mdash;but that is more than enough of
the tiresome old bores.</p>
<p>
And after each piece of advice the
little Tridges would all say, "Right-O!"</p>
<p>
And then one night&mdash;these being
English Tridges in an English early
summer&mdash;a terrible frost set in which
lasted long enough to kill the whole
covey, partly by cold and partly by
starvation, so that all the good counsels
were wasted.</p>
<p>
But on the chance that one or two of
them may be applicable to human life
I have jotted them down here. One
never knows which is grain and which
chaff until afterwards.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h4><span style="font-weight: normal;">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</span></h4>
<p>
We have had many studies of the War, in various aspects,
from our own army. Now in <i>My <b>&middot;</b>75</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>) there
comes a record of the impressions of a French gunner
during the first year of fighting. It is a book of which I
should find it difficult to speak too highly. <span class="sc">Paul Lintier</span>,
the writer, had, it is clear, a gift for recording things seen
with quite unusual sharpness of effect. His word-pictures
of the mobilisation, the departure for the Front, and the
fighting from the Marne to the Aisne (where he was wounded
and sent home) carry one along with a suspense and interest
and quite personal emotion that are a tribute to their
artistry. His death (the short preface tells us that, having
returned to the Front, he was killed in action in March, 1916)
has certainly robbed France of one who should have made
a notable figure in her literature. The style, very distinctive,
shows poetic feeling and a rare and beautiful tenderness
of thought, mingled with an acceptance of the brutality of
life and war that is seen in the vivid descriptions
of incidents that our own gentler writers would have left
untold. The horror of some of these passages makes the book (I
should warn you) not one for shaken nerves. But there can be no
question of its very unusual interest, nor of the skill with which its
translator, who should surely be acknowledged upon the title-page, has
preserved the vitality and appeal of the original.</p>

<p>
The author of <i>Helen
of Four Gates</i> (<span class="sc">Jenkins</span>)
has chosen to hide her
identity and call herself simply "An Ex-Mill Girl." I
am sufficiently sorry for this to hope that, if the story
meets with the success that I should certainly predict
for it, a lady of such unusual gifts may allow us to know
her name. Of these gifts I have no doubt whatever. As a
tale <i>Helen of Four Gates</i> is crude, unnatural, melodramatic;
but the power (brutality, if you prefer) of its telling takes
away the critical breath. Whether in real life anyone could
have nursed a lifelong hatred as old <i>Mason</i> did (personally
I cherish the belief that hatred is too evanescent an emotion
for a life-tenancy of the human mind; but I may be wrong);
whether he would have bribed a casual tramp to marry and
torment the reputed daughter who was the object of his
loathing, or whether <i>Day</i> and <i>Helen</i> herself would actually
so have played into his hands, are all rather questionable
problems. Far more real, human and moving is the wild
passion of <i>Helen</i> for <i>Martin</i>, whom (again questionably as
to truth) her enemies frighten away from her. A grim
story, you begin to observe, but one altogether worth reading.
To compare things small (as yet) with great, I might call
it a lineal descendant of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, both in setting
and treatment. There is indeed more than a hint of the
<span class="sc">Brontë</span> touch about the Ex-Mill Girl. For that and other
things I send her (whoever she is) my felicitations and good
wishes.</p>

     <hr />
<p>
I wonder if Mr. (or Mrs. or Miss) E.K. <span class="sc">Weekes</span> would
understand me if I put my verdict upon <i>The Massareen
Affair</i> (<span class="sc">Arnold</span>) into the form of a suggestion that in future
its author would be well advised to keep quiet, Not with
any meaning that he or she should desist from the pursuit
of fiction; on the contrary, there are aspects of <i>The
Massareen Affair</i> that are more than promising&mdash;vigorous
and unconventional characters, a gift of lively talk, and so
on. But all this only operates so long as the tale remains
in the calm waters of the ordinary; later, when it puts
forth upon the sea of melodrama, I am sorry to record that
this promising vessel comes as near shipwreck as makes no
difference. To drop metaphor, the group of persons surrounding
the unhappily-wedded <i>Anthony Massareen</i>&mdash;<i>Claudia</i>,
who attempts to rescue him and his two boys,
the boys themselves, and the clerical family whose fortunes
are affected by their proximity to the <i>Massareens</i>&mdash;all these
are well and credibly drawn. But when we arrive at the
fanatic wife of <i>Anthony</i>, in her Welsh castle, surrounded by
rocks and blow-holes, and finally to that last great scene,
where (if I followed events accurately) she trusses her ex-husband
like a fowl, and trundles him in a wheel-barrow to the pyre of sacrifice,
not the best will in the world could keep me convinced or even decorously
thrilled. So I will content myself with repeating my advice to
a clever writer in future to ride imagination on the curb, and leave you
to endorse this or not as taste suggests.</p>

     <hr />
<p>
I am seriously thinking of chaining <i>Grand Fleet Days</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
and Stoughton</span>) to my bookcase, for it is written by the author
of <i>In the Northern Mists</i>, a book which has destroyed
the morality of my friends. Be assured that I am not
formulating any grave charge against the anonymous
Chaplain of the Fleet who has provided us with these
two delightful volumes; I merely wish to say that nothing
can prevent people from purloining the first, and that
drastic measures will have to be taken if I am to retain the
second. In these dialogues and sketches I do not find
quite so much spontaneity as in the first volume; once or
twice it is even possible to imagine that the author, after
taking pen in hand, was a little perplexed to find a subject
to write about. But that is the beginning and the end
of my complaint. Once again we have a broad-minded
humour and the revelation of a most attractive personality.
Above all we see our Grand Fleet as it is; and, if the
grumblers would only read and soundly digest what our
Chaplain has to say their question would be, "What is our
Navy <i>not</i> doing?"</p>

<p>
It must indeed have been a wonderful sight. Nevertheless
we hope that nurses generally will stick to their

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
